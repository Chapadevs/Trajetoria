          'The Trajetória project was born from the need to rethink how young people build their personal and professional paths in a world in constant transformation. In a scenario marked by anxiety, social pressure and the speed of technological changes, many students reach the end of basic education without clarity about their talents, skills or future possibilities.',
        sectionP2:
          'School, still based on a traditional model inherited from the Industrial Revolution, maintains a structure that values repetition and technical performance, but does little to stimulate self-knowledge, creativity and critical thinking. In this context, career guidance becomes limited, treating career choices as isolated decisions, and not as part of a process of human and emotional discovery.',
        sectionP3:
          'Trajetória emerges as a response to this challenge: a digital platform developed in the Visual Design course at Universidade Positivo, which integrates psychology, strategic design and technology to promote self-knowledge and professional reflection. Through visual, interactive and accessible experiences, the tool invites young people to understand that human beings are made up of multiple intelligences, skills and powers — and that no journey is linear.',
        sectionP4:
          'The platform uses recognized tests, such as Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences, DISC, RIASEC and Jungian Archetypes, to help users map their strengths, understand their behaviors and visualize possible paths for personal and professional growth.',
        sectionP5:
          'More than indicating professions, the project seeks to reconnect the individual with their purpose, awakening a sense of belonging and autonomy in the face of future uncertainties. Thus, Trajetória consolidates itself as a contemporary compass that guides, inspires and leads young people towards a more conscious, balanced and meaningful life — where learning, working and living once again walk side by side.',

          'O projeto Trajetória nasce da necessidade de repensar o modo como jovens constroem seus caminhos pessoais e profissionais em um mundo em constante transformação. Em um cenário marcado pela ansiedade, pela pressão social e pela velocidade das mudanças tecnológicas, muitos estudantes chegam ao fim da educação básica sem clareza sobre seus talentos, habilidades ou possibilidades de futuro.',
        sectionP2:
          'A escola, ainda pautada em um modelo tradicional herdado da Revolução Industrial, mantém uma estrutura que valoriza a repetição e o desempenho técnico, mas pouco estimula o autoconhecimento, a criatividade e o pensamento crítico. Nesse contexto, a orientação profissional se torna limitada, tratando escolhas de carreira como decisões isoladas, e não como parte de um processo de descoberta humana e emocional.',
        sectionP3:
          'A Trajetória surge como uma resposta a esse desafio: uma plataforma digital desenvolvida no curso de Design Visual da Universidade Positivo, que integra psicologia, design estratégico e tecnologia para promover o autoconhecimento e a reflexão profissional. Por meio de experiências visuais, interativas e acessíveis, a ferramenta convida o jovem a compreender que o ser humano é formado por múltiplas inteligências, habilidades e potências — e que nenhuma trajetória é linear.',
        sectionP4:
          'A plataforma utiliza testes reconhecidos, como Múltiplas Inteligências de Gardner, DISC, RIASEC e Arquétipos de Jung, para ajudar o usuário a mapear seus forças, compreender seus comportamentos e visualizar caminhos possíveis de crescimento pessoal e profissional.',
        sectionP5:
          'Mais do que indicar profissões, o projeto busca reconectar o indivíduo com seu propósito, despertando o sentimento de pertencimento e autonomia diante das incertezas do futuro. Assim, a Trajetória se consolida como uma bússola contemporânea, que orienta, inspira e guia o jovem em direção a uma vida mais consciente, equilibrada e significativa — onde aprender, trabalhar e viver voltam a caminhar lado a lado.',
